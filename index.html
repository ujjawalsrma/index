                        grasslands, savannas, semi-arid regions, and even islands. A few species buck this trend and
                        prefer colder climates, such as the Kea parrot, which inhabits the alpine regions of the South
                        Island of New Zealand. Parrots are so much more than the stereotypical pirate “accessory” often
